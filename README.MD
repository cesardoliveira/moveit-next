# Move It App
This is a front-end application as part of project that was built during the event Next Level Week 4 by Rocketseat. This project was bootstrapped with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

This application was built to learn how to use the React Framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) in React.

"Move.It" is an app that combines the Pomodoro technique with physical exercises for those who spend a lot of time in front of the computer.
